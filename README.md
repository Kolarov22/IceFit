### Short description:
The “IceFit” application is a platform designed to assist people in achieving their goal of a healthier lifestyle, which includes training exercises, nutrition guides, and fitness goals. It can facilitate communication between instructors and clients.
To accomplish this, we are going to use a stack of technologies. We are considering using ReactJS for the front-end and Spring for the back-end, connected to a mySQL database.


### Features:
- Instructors can create accounts in which they can keep track of clients and their training.
- Instructors can edit and add training and nutrition plans.
- Clients can create accounts to view their personalized nutrition and training plans.
- Clients can see their evolution and track progress.
- Instructors and clients can chat each other.
- Admins have access to all information of the database.
- Clients can pay for the services in a secure manner.
